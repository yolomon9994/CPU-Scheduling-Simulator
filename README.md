A simple CPU Scheduling Simulator made in C, that provides a comparison between selected CPU Scheduling Algorithms and gives the best output among them.
Current implement algorithms are:
> First Come First Serve
> Shortest Job First
> Round Robin

Provides functions to compare all 3 algorithms and compare between two.

Also provides functionality to save results to a txt file

Uses a GUI implementation.

Tested and Works in Ubuntu environment

Designed to be modular for scalibility. Can add more algorithms and further metrics.
